That was off, so I can no longer go back and get it. At first - it spit out formulas to use =TODAY function to build future dates… so it was only good in relation to the day I would build it. Then, when I prompted it away from that - it wanted to use a date as a reference - something similar to what is below. It just repackaged the concept of a =TODAY function into a static date to reference. Still not what I want - and now I am barking up a tree that is reliant on a single, random date… not what I want.

For example - if I open the sheet on Wednesday, August 13th, 2025, cell b7 needs to display Monday, August 11th in cell B7. If I open the document on Thursday, August 14th, 2025, cell b7 needs to still display Monday, August 11th in cell b7.</p>

For now, I just want to claim a small win over the powers that be at my dysfunctional job that things don't function because they are like me when I started this task - I didn't even know what to ask, because I fundamentally didn't even understand the questions that had to be asked, the tools there now to do this manually, etc… the difference is when I want to know, I take the time to learn. I ask. I implement. I see what works, what doesn't. I love the work. The process. The questions. The questions that the questions bring up. I just want to be at a place that cares to try and ask the right questions, or better yet, at least care enough to show up to this studio in the first place. A quality work environment where I can be around people who think to think. That is all.</p>

                <p><strong>Total Time:</strong> I typed every thought throughout it to show a POW and thought - so it took 3 hours total, but in reality I think I thought and asked questions for 1 ½ and typed my thoughts for another 1 ½. Probably not efficient if I had to guess compared to a Sam Altman or prompter who has been doing this for many years, but I am very proud I was able to do it, and will be automating every last piece of my antiquated workflow as much as possible while I am still here. At least it provides a baseline to work from, and learn from.</p>

                <h2>Financial Impact</h2>
                
                <p>Well, they already fired people. Lol. In theory though - my company saved <strong>$65k in salary</strong> by cutting the person who would have this in their workflow. I believe this process can be used to automate most of the board operators they pay to be there full time, the technical directors they have reminding live on air talent of times, and all of our podcast editing/posting. I do not know how much everyone through that process gets paid exactly, but I can round based on what information I do have access to - you save <strong>(1) board operator in wages, (1) technical director in wages</strong>, and more down the line as I keep building and learning…</p>
                
                <p>That is <strong>($130k) in salary costs per year</strong> that can be saved per live show. With our current workflow, that is <strong>($390k) in salary saved in our down season</strong> (sports network, summer). If I use last years workflow in football season, you are probably looking at an additional <strong>($455k) in savings</strong> for independent contractor work for temporary shows, and the full time roles above. The numbers are very rough estimates that likely no longer directly apply after layoffs and content still not being planned for me to use to reference in the future yet. It would be really interesting to get those numbers, the content plan, etc… and give a POW writeup on it where I can show where and how for every single show, things can be run more efficiently.</p>

                <h2>Future Applications</h2>
                
                <h3>Future of my company:</h3>
                <p>Can be applied to clips being cut for syndication, graphics, and even more that I am not seeing while at the studio. We have a ton of remote contracted work that might fit into this niche, but this company has not done employee reviews since 2021… so no one even knows the whole story.</p>

                <h3>Future for me:</h3>
                <p>I want to be aligned with a workplace/workflow that actually 1) wants to work, and 2) is ambitious and not afraid to just try things. Why I think this role at Coinbase is perfect for me is because it functions the same way I think. Proof of Work not just for blockchains, but for thinking. Not rushing always to the end result as fast as possible, but using my background in crypto and being a disruptor by financial nature to think through every last step to make a goal a reality. Coinbase has done that - with their work in D.C., the Base blockchain, the Coinbase CEX…Every last thing works like a blockchain. Connected. Meant to build and aid each other. A beautiful financial ecosystem that relays data just like Bitcoin. It's amazing.</p>
                
                <p>Am I the most polished developer? Or the most experienced AI prompter? Of course not, but I am Coinbase fundamentally. When I was brought in by my boss to transition into an engineering role, he asked me to learn our entire "Master Control" room. I did not start by walking into that room and asking what buttons do what. I met everyone who has and still does work it. I asked our CTO how he sees it, and just soaked in all the info they had. I spoke to the head of security at the front, Erin. I spoke to our receptionist. What I got the first week was a mobile app to remotely control every single door in the building. An understanding of how every single item shows up in our studio. When you start from too high up, you often forget what happens at the bottom. You need someone who gets that to even attempt fundamentally changing anything.</p>
